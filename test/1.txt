			Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, 
			conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

			Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived 
			and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come 
			to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives 
			that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
